CAB ANALYZER — “SMART + MUSICAL” PRODUCT SPEC (NO AUDIO REQUIRED)

GOALS
- Musical language first, technical detail second (collapsible).
- Clear “why” explanations.
- Taste learning is prominent and rewarding.
- Avoid fake precision (no 6-decimal numbers, no “scientific certainty”).

============================================================
1) TOP-LEVEL UX FLOW (ONE SIMPLE PATH)
============================================================
Primary tabs (left-to-right):
1) Analyze
2) Cull
3) Compare
4) Taste (A/B)
5) Export

Each tab has:
- 1 primary action button
- 1 short “what this does” sentence

============================================================
2) TONAL DASHBOARD (MUSICAL FIRST)
============================================================
For each IR, show 5 musical descriptors + a fingerprint bar:

A) Tilt: Dark / Neutral / Bright
B) Body: Lean / Balanced / Thick (250–500)
C) Bite: Soft / Defined / Aggressive (2–4k)
D) Fizz: Controlled / Elevated (6–10k)
E) Smoothness: Smooth / Ripple / Comb Risk

PLUS: Tonal Fingerprint Bar (Sub/Bass/Low-mid/Mid/High-mid/Presence/Air)

Under each descriptor, add ONE short sentence:
- “Why: slightly elevated 2–4k with controlled rolloff”
- “Why: low-mid is strong without excess sub”

No raw numbers by default.

============================================================
3) “SHOW ME THE RECEIPTS” (SMART BUT NOT CLUTTERY)
============================================================
Add a small expandable panel:
[Details ▼]

Contains:
- Tilt numeric
- Rolloff Hz
- SmoothScore numeric
- Max notch depth + notch count
- EarlyWindowMs used (85)
- Tail metric status: N/A (short IR) or value

Default collapsed.

============================================================
4) BATCH ANALYSIS SUMMARY (SMART FEEL)
============================================================
When analyzing a batch, show:
- “Most versatile” (closest to your taste OR neutral reference if no taste yet)
- “Brightest”, “Darkest”
- “Thickest”, “Most cutting”
- “Smoothest”, “Most comb-risk”
- “Redundancy heat”: high / medium / low (set-level)

Each item is clickable to open the IR details.

============================================================
5) CULL TAB SHOULD FEEL LIKE A PRO ENGINEER
============================================================
Output:
- Keep-set (N shots) with labels:
  - Anchor (most versatile)
  - Bright option
  - Dark option
  - Thick option
  - Cut option
  - Smooth option

For every IR you suggest removing:
- Show “Redundant with: X” + a one-line why:
  - “Very similar tilt and presence balance; differences under threshold.”

Provide a “Variety Meter” for the keep-set:
- Low / Medium / High

============================================================
6) COMPARE TAB (MUSICAL MATCHING)
============================================================
For any IR, show:
- “Closest matches” (to pro IRs and/or your own favorites)
- Each match includes:
  - Match confidence: High / Med / Low
  - 2 reasons in musician language:
    - “Similar bite and rolloff; slightly leaner body.”

Do NOT claim “best” unless trained.

============================================================
7) TASTE (A/B) TAB — MAKE IT FUN + PROGRESSIVE
============================================================
Design principles:
- Always show 2 choices, plus 1 “too close / tie” option.
- Always show 1 sentence describing the difference:
  - “A has more bite; B has more body.”

Progress:
- “Taste confidence” meter:
  - Low (<20 votes)
  - Medium (20–60)
  - High (60+)

Rewards:
- “What I learned about you” card (updates every 10 votes):
  - “You usually prefer: moderate bite + controlled fizz + solid body.”
(Keep it humble language: “usually”, “tends to”.)

============================================================
8) RECOMMENDATIONS SHOULD ADAPT TO TRAINING STAGE
============================================================
Before training:
- Use neutral reference + genre heuristics cautiously
- Label: “General guidance (not personalized yet)”

After training:
- Use personalized taste vector
- Label: “Personalized to your taste”

============================================================
9) LANGUAGE RULES (IMPORTANT)
============================================================
Always write:
- “tends to”
- “likely”
- “in this batch”
- “relative to your library”
Avoid:
- “objectively best”
- “correct tone”
- “perfect IR”

============================================================
10) EXPORT TAB (MUSICAL OUTPUT)
============================================================
Export a simple CSV/JSON:
- filename
- musical descriptors (Tilt/Body/Bite/Fizz/Smoothness)
- keep/remove + redundantWith
- notes (“bright option”, “anchor”, etc.)
- analysis meta (featureVersion, 85ms window, etc.)
